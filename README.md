# IAP-STM32F
#h1 STM In-Application Programming (IAP) Project
#h5 Overview
This project implements an In-Application Programming (IAP) solution for STM microcontrollers. In-Application Programming allows the microcontroller's firmware to be updated over a communication interface (e.g., UART, I2C, CAN, etc.) while the application is running, without the need for external programming tools.

The IAP solution is designed to be robust and reliable, ensuring that firmware updates can be performed safely in the field.

#h1 How To Use It.

#h4 main.c

```
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */

  Main_Menu();
  /* USER CODE END 2 */

```
